/**
 * `npm run push:remote` — mirror the local corpus into the hosted Turso database.
 *
 * The write pipeline stays where it is. Ingest, enrich, ghost and linkcheck all run against
 * the local `workie.db` with the synchronous driver and their transactions intact; this
 * copies the result up afterwards, so a hosted read replica costs the pipeline nothing.
 *
 * Idempotent, by upsert rather than by replace: every row is written under its local id and
 * overwrites whatever is there. That is what makes it safe to run at the end of every refresh
 * cycle, and it means a batch that fails leaves the site serving a complete-but-older corpus
 * rather than a half-empty one.
 *
 * Migrations are applied first, and drizzle's migrator skips the ones already recorded — so a
 * first run bootstraps an empty database and later runs are a no-op on that step.
 *
 *   npm run push:remote
 *   npm run push:remote -- --to=file:/tmp/mirror.db     a local libSQL file, no account
 *
 * Strays ARE deleted, and they have to be. This used to say that nothing here deletes, on the
 * grounds that ingest never removes a posting — delisting is a column. `merge:duplicates`
 * broke that: it collapses duplicate rows, and an upsert alone cannot express a deletion, so
 * the remote kept serving rows the local corpus had merged away. It also FAILED outright, and
 * the failure is worth keeping in mind because it is not obvious. Merging freed a `dedupe_key`
 * locally, the next ingest moved that key onto the surviving row, and upserting that row into a
 * remote where the deleted twin still held the key violated the UNIQUE index. Deleting first is
 * what makes the key available before anything claims it.
