/**
 * Deterministic extraction — no model, no network, no cost.
 *
 * Precedence is the whole design:
 *
 *   structured field from the source  >  the posting's own text  >  null
 *
 * and within the text the TITLE outranks the body, because a title states what the role is
 * while a body merely mentions things ("internships count" sits in the requirements of a
 * full-time posting). `track` is the one field that reads title -> department/team -> body
 * rather than putting the structured field first: a title is a stronger signal of the role
 * than the org chart it hangs off, and "Platform Engineer" in a Sales department is still an
 * engineer. Each extractor names its own order where it differs.
 *
 * Never guess past that. NULL means "the posting did not say", which is a real answer the UI
 * knows how to render (finding G); a guessed value is indistinguishable from a stated one
 * and is worse than nothing.
 *
 * The reason this is viable at all is `SourceFields`: Ashby returns `employmentType`,
 * `workplaceType` and a postal address, Lever returns `categories.commitment` and an
 * already-structured `lists[]`, Greenhouse returns `departments[]` and `offices[]`. Parsing
 * that back out of prose when the API handed it to us as a field is absurd, so the
 * connectors preserve it and this module reads it first (see `ConnectorPosting`).
 *
 * Extraction is free and deterministic, so there is no cache: re-running is correct and
 * cheap, and a cache would only mean that changing a rule here silently serves the old
 * answer forever.
